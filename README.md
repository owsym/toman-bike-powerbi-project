# Toman Bike Data Analysis in Power BI
- This project analyzes Toman bike data using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization.

### Data Source
- The data source for this project is not specified. It likely originated from a database containing information about Toman bikes.

### Data Cleaning
- The initial data cleaning process was done using SQL. This may have involved tasks such as,
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
= Formatting data types
= Deriving new calculated fields
= Data Visualization

### Power BI was used to create various visualizations of the cleaned Toman bike data. The specific visualizations used include:

- Line Charts: Tracked trends and patterns over time hourly, daily, weekly, monthly bike usage.
- Stacked Bar Charts: Compared multiple categories within a single dimension bike usage by rider type across locations.
- Donut Chart: Displayed the proportional distribution of data across categories  breakdown of bike types.
- Matrix Table: Provided a flexible way to analyze summarized data comparing ride duration, number of rides by location or rider type.
- Line Bar Chart (Custom?): This unique chart type might have visualized a trend alongside additional categorical data points.
- New Cards: Displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) for Toman bikes total rides, available bikes, average trip distance.
